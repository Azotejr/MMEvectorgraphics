- I found a very clear explanation of how graphic graphics work.
- “…vector graphics, where objects are constructed from geometric lines and curves, rather than raster graphics, where an image is a rectangular array of discrete pixels…construct a path in a two dimensional coordinate system of almost unlimited precision, so that the geometry of the drawing is independent of the resolution of the output device. Paths can be built from straight line segments or from curves called Bezier splines, defined by cubic equations. The operators stroke and fill can the be applied to create a visible graphic object.”


**Complex Vectors and Image Identification (http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2686789.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:7830c0b01f1034ef2de56fc8643d9aaa)**
- This article talks about how vector graphics can be used to teach the computer to recognize a certain shape or object. The camera/pixelated image is first transformed into a feature vector, and the computer can recognize it even if its size, filling, or direction has changed. Even with approximated contour, the computer can still process some mathematical calculations and recognize the shape. Unfortunately, the article claims itself using “college level” related math, I could not understand a bit of it.
