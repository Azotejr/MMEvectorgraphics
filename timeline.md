# Timeline of Vector Graphics


**1960s-1970s**
Invented and being used in millitary systems.

**1963**
Ivan Sutherland invented *Sketchpad*, the ancester of computer-aided design program.

**1970s-1980s**
Researchers began to develop letters digitally.

**1980s-1990s**
Programs like *Icarus*, *Adobe Illustrator* and *Aldus* Freehand were introduced as important tools to transit traditional typefaces into digital forms, so that they could be displayed and used on computer screens.

**1981**
The *Xerox Star* computer came out with a high resolution graphical user interface, which also allowed users to control over a mouse.

**1984**
The Apple *Macintosh* computer came out with WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), as technologies such as bitmapped fonts.

**1985**
Three typefaces, Emperor, Oakland, and Emigre, were designed by Zuzanna Licko. And they influenced many typographic designs afterwards.
Around the same time, anti-aliasing technology was introduced to solve the problem of pixelated letters on screen. *"Antialiasing solved this problem by blurring the edge of the letter into its background. For example, the edges of a black letter resting on a white background, when antialiased, reveal the insertion of gray pixels along the contours of the letter. Only computer systems capable of displaying more than two colors (black and white) could support antialiasing. While antialiasing eliminates the jagged look of letters on the computer screen, it also diminishes their legibility by decreasing edge contrast. The loss of contrast between letter and background virtually obliterates smaller sizes of antialiased type."*
