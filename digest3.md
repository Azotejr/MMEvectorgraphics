# Vector Graphics
*Digest 3*

*Notes: This week I focused on the use of vector technologies in digital typography, which could be the main focus of my research.*

- These two articles gave a brief history of how typography was developed and made into digital versions. The important events are the introducing of several new types of computers that allows graphical user interfaces and the invention of several software programs that allows artists and designers to convert typefaces to a digital form. It was very interesting seeing people actually first made pixelated fonts and then started to trace others. Also I enjoyed this paragraph describing antialiasing technology.
- *"Antialiasing solved this problem by blurring the edge of the letter into its background. For example, the edges of a black letter resting on a white background, when antialiased, reveal the insertion of gray pixels along the contours of the letter. Only computer systems capable of displaying more than two colors (black and white) could support antialiasing. While antialiasing eliminates the jagged look of letters on the computer screen, it also diminishes their legibility by decreasing edge contrast. The loss of contrast between letter and background virtually obliterates smaller sizes of antialiased type."*

- This article gives more of a general view on the history of graphic designs, and how it was related to typography. It is very interesting that multiple historical designs was interpreted differently.
