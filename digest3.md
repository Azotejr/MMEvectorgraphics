*Notes: This week I focused on how to make a font by yourself using vector images.*

- From my research, if you are building a font by yourself as an individual, there are mainly two ways of doing it.

- The first way is the most basic way, by using a vector editor(Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape) and a font making program(FontForge, FontLab, FontSelf). Basically you draw the alphabet in the vector drawing program, and then import them to the font editor to make small modifications and export them as a font file. The following is a simple tutorial using this technique: **How to create your own font EASY TUTORIAL** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucUv1_SF4tg)

- The second way of doing this is using a existing font making program called Calligraphr. It turns your photographed/scanned handwriting into vectors and directly to a font file. (There should be more program out there that does the same thing but this is the only one I found to be useful.) So if you are not familiar with vector programs, you can use this simple method instead. Here is the link for it: **Transform your handwriting or
calligraphy into a font!** (https://www.calligraphr.com/en/)
