#Technological Ecology Report

Ecologically, vector image is a very friendly technology as it provides ways to compress a very huge file into a small one. Also, when you are printing very large files, if you could make it using vector graphics, then less storage is needed.

However, on the other hand, vector technologies provides a way in which people invented digital typograhy and different type faces that could be used for printing. This gives people a changce to print things on paper in a very easy way and is thus less environmental friendly.
