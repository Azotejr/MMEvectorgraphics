- This is a video about a font vectorized by codes, and can be used for programming. It's fairly interesting to see how the vector shapes can be changed just by adjusting a little bit of the codes, and it gives a very general view of how vector shapes are used in typographic designs.

- These are two different websites I found showing fonts that are suitable for programming, after watching the video above.
- It's very interesting to see how programers react to a font, as most of them focuses mostly on the readability but not really the design aspect as I do.
- They give comments such as "The '-' symbol is short
", "Ligatures are nice-looking but harm clarity
", "Hard to distinguish '8' from 'B' at low sizes
", which are all very pragmatic comments for me. It's very interesting to see things from a different perspective.
