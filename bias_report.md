#Technological Bias report

When talking about the technological bias of the vector image technology, one of the first thing that comes to mind is that it is a kind of technology that has a bias towards those who can see. The ones who invented this technology certainly did not intend to do so, but what they using as the most elementary base is computers and graphical displays. The ones who are not able to see cannot see the computer screen, and they certainly have no access to the vector technologies. This is actually one of the most prevailing bias in most of the new technologies. Pretty much every new devise is screen based and supports only service for the ones who can see. There is a few things the blind people could do to interact with screen based technologies.

It might be just a very minor point, but also, I think vector technology has a bias towards minimalistic/flat sort of aesthetics. When vectorizing a image, what people do is that they leave out many details of raster images, and turn everything into simple shapes and gradients.
